# confusion-matrix
While working on a Machine Learning project, I wrote this pair of Python 3 functions in Jupyter Notebook to:

1. Manually calculate confusion matrix from test_y and test_predictions (manually_calculate_tp_tn_fp_fn.py)
2. Nicely format the confusion matrix output in a table (display_confusion_matrix.py)

I have also written a blog article about this here:<BR>
