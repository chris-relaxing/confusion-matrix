# confusion_matrix
While working on a Machine Learning project, I wrote this pair of Python 3 functions in Jupyter Notebook to:

1. Manually calculate confusion matrix from test_y and test_predictions
2. Nicely format the confusion matrix output in a table

I have also written a blog article about this here:<BR>
